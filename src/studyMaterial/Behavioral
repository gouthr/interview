Strengths:
==========
1. Complete ownership and responsibility of all tasks/projects assigned
	-irrespective of if I'm only a part of a small task in the complete project
	-initiate to help peers to take on more tasks/project to closure
2. Fast turn-around time with good quality of all my projects
	-I take it as a challenge to myself to complete it at the earliest possible
3. Good communicator and complete team player

Weaknesses/Learnings as a TL:
==================
1. Creating more visibility to the team and project is something I've started doing on a more frequent cadence
	- This has helped create more visibility to the team
	- Opportunities for new use cases which would otherwise have gone un-noticed. Example- A/B test framework 
	for internal Twitter experimentation purposes was something that came up due to this effort. They had this use case 
	to use our A/B test framework to curate targetted ads from a catalog of ads based on targetting criteria.
2. Helping other team members to grow
	- Earlier I would take on the critical or the most imporatnt component. But now I let the team chose their areas and I work on the remaining tasks. 
	That said, actively involved in design, architecture and code reviews.
	Also, jumping in when needed to unblock and meet the deadlines

Weaknesses:
===========
1. I wanted to be very involved in all my projects, so was not very good at delegation
	-I worked on it and now I'm more comfortable delegating but I'm actively involved in code reviews and feedback
	-This has helped me take on more projects (work on more projects) and also helped me enhance my mentoring skills
	-Now I'm actively involved in hiring and screening process


Accomplishment:
================
1. Take an idea from conception to design, implementation and rollout ww
	-Unsubscribe project
		-Convinced the Product Management team of the need of this feature and got it approved
		-Coming up with a design after carefully go through the RFC
		-Implementation leading a team of 3 members	
		-Code deployment, rollout and monitoring
		-Thought about localization issues for user friendly message
2. Sendas/forward security fix

Failed project/ Not so proud:
=============================
1. Unable to promote and retain a good engineer inspite of our efforts to help the engineer grow
	- Mostly due to the current unstable state of Twitter going through aquisition and changing process
	- Worked closely to help close the gap and everything was on track. Delays due to the unstable state and 
	processes led to losing a good enginner on the team
2. WireTap project 
	-Had to work on a very tight schedule with no test framework
	-Lead to some missing functionality on porting
	-Mismatch in types of the subject header
	-Missed rolling out the changes to IMAP protocol - it was the way the services are deployed
	-a config change and it lead to WT outage
	
Questions to ask the interviewer:
=================================
1. What characteristics do you look for in a successful SE at Uber?
2. What are some of the challenges of a SE at Uber?
3. What made someone stand out in the past at Uber?
4. What is the ratio of PM to dev to QA and what are the processess followed - like agile

Why Uber:
=========
1. I'm interested in working on challenges involved in distributed systems at scale and what better than Uber
2. Also, it would be a privilege to work on a consumer facing product (Something that u worked on is being used on a daily basis)

Netflix:
========
As we wrote in the beginning, what is special about Netflix is how much we:
1. encourage independent decision-making by employees
	-You make wise decisions despite ambiguity
	-You identify root causes, and get beyond treating symptoms
	-You think strategically, and can articulate what you are, and are not, trying to do
	-You are good at using data to inform your intuition
	-You make decisions based on the long term, not near term
	Example- Prioritized a feature based on market research and took it from concept to deployment - Unsubscribe feature
2. share information openly, broadly, and deliberately
	-We share documents internally broadly and systematically. Nearly every document is fully open for anyone to read and comment on, 
	and everything is cross-linked. Memos on each title’s performance, on every strategy decision, on every competitor, 
	and on every product feature test are open for all employees to read. Despite this huge access, we’ve had very few leaks,
	due to our ethos of self-discipline and responsibility.
	Example - All our design specs are shared across all groups. We brainstorm, discuss and finalize the design approach taking all
	views into account.
3. are extraordinarily candid with each other
	-give and receive feedback on a regular basis, to get better
	Example - Raised the concern of not getting enough traction to low-priority projects. Instead got involved and took a high priority
	project to closure. This helped in finishing the other project ahead of time and also helped get traction on the low priority project. 
4. keep only our highly effective people
5. avoid rules
	-results over process
	Example - Push process was manual and slow. Suggested and involved in introducing an automated push process (Beta metrics).

	-long term results over short term
	-Best interest of the company than individual
	-Identify root cause, and get beyond treating symptoms

	-timely feedback
Curiosity
	-learn rapidly and eagerly
	-contribute outside of your speciality
Courage

	-challenging the status quo
Passion
	-inspire others with your thirst for knowledge
Selflessness
	-open minded in search of best ideas
Innovation
	-create new ideas that prove useful
	-minimizing complexity and finding time to simplify
	-thrive on change
Inclusion
	-collaborate effectively with people of diverse backgrounds and cultures
	-nurture and embrace differing perspectives to make better decisions
Integrity

Dream team
	-Like a sports team rather than a family. Every member is the best at what they do 
	while supporting and collaborating with other team members
Freedom & responsibility
	-We work to have a company of self-disciplined people who discover and fix issues without being told to do so.
	-Results over process
Informed Captains
	-For every significant decision there is a responsible captain of the ship who makes a judgment call after digesting others’ views. 
	We avoid committees making decisions because that would slow us down, and diffuse responsibility and accountability
Context and not control
	-We want employees to be great independent decision makers, and to only consult their manager when they are unsure of the right decision.
	The leader’s job at every level is to set clear context so that others have the right information to make generally great decisions.
Highly aligned, loosely coupled
	As companies grow, they often become highly centralized and inflexible. Symptoms include:

	Senior management is involved in many small decisions
	There are numerous cross-departmental buy-in meetings to socialize tactics
	Pleasing other internal groups takes precedence over pleasing customers
	The organization is highly coordinated and less prone to error, but slow and frustrating
	
	-We avoid this by being highly aligned and loosely coupled. We spend lots of time debating strategy together, 
	and then trust each other to execute on tactics without prior approvals.
Seeking excellence
	-We do not seek to preserve our culture — we seek to improve it.
